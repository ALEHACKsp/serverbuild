# serverbuilder
Serverbuilder is a simple app that lets you easily clone other Discord servers by pasting a unique code into the server. The bot will do everything else for you.

### Prerequisites
- If you are going to run this on a bot account, make sure it is on less than 10 servers as Discord only allows server creation for bots that are in less than 10 guilds.
